hbox is a Command Line Interface (CLI) that leverages container technology to manage packages, powered by Rust ðŸ¦€.

## Features

hbox offers the following features:

- **Container Isolation**: hbox uses containers to isolate packages, allowing multiple versions of a package to coexist without conflict.
- **Robust Configuration Options**: hbox enables high customization through configuration files. You can define package aliases and setup automatic volume mounts via `config.json`.
- **Support for Pipes**: hbox supports the use of pipes in `hbox run`, which allows you to chain commands efficiently.
- **Convenient Shims**: hbox creates `shims` (alias shortcuts) for all installed packages, simplifying command entry from `hbox run <package alias> <commands>` to `<package alias> <commands>`.

## Commands

```sh
$ hbox -h
CLI tool that leverages container technology to manage packages.

Usage: hbox <COMMAND>

Commands:
  info    Print debug information
  list    List all installed packages and their versions
  add     Add a specific version of a package
  remove  Remove a package
  use     Set current version of a package
  run     Run the package
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

## Installation

To install hbox via `cargo`, run the following command:

```sh
cargo add hbox
```

## Setup

### Shims and Shell Configuration

hbox utilizes shims and a configuration file to effectively manage your installed packages. For the successful addition of `$HBOX_DIR/shims` at the correct priority level to your path, these lines of code should be added to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```sh
export HBOX_DIR="$HOME/.hbox"
export PATH="$HBOX_DIR/shims":$PATH
```

### Configuration via config.json

The configuration of packages in hbox is managed by the `$HBOX_DIR/config.json` file. This file, which is created automatically upon adding a package, contains information such as package aliases pointing to multiple registries and volume mounts:

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "packages": {
    "curl": {
      "image": "docker.io/curlimages/curl"
    },
    "aws": {
      "image": "docker.io/amazon/aws-cli",
      "volumes": [
        {
          "source": "~/.aws",
          "target": "/root/.aws"
        }
      ]
    },
    "lambda_python": {
      "image": "public.ecr.aws/lambda/python"
    },
    "jq": {
      "image": "ghcr.io/jqlang/jq"
    },
    "terraform": {
      "image": "docker.io/hashicorp/terraform"
    },
    "fga": {
      "image": "docker.io/openfga/cli"
    }
  }
}
```

You can use the `config.json` to also override the registry of any container image. By default, we pull from `docker.io`.

### Package Version Management via versions.json

hbox also creates and maintains a `$HBOX_DIR/versions.json` file that keeps track of the current version of each package. This file is under the management of hbox itself and shouldn't be manually edited:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "name": "aws",
      "versions": [
        "latest"
      ],
      "current": "latest"
    },
    {
      "name": "jq",
      "versions": [
        "latest",
        "1.7rc2"
      ],
      "current": "1.7rc2"
    },
    {
      "name": "node",
      "versions": [
        "latest",
        "14",
        "15"
      ],
      "current": "15"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Below are some examples demonstrating how you can use `hbox`:

```sh
> hbox version
0.1.1
> hbox list
> hbox add jq
latest: Pulling from jqlang/jq
...
Added 'jq' version latest.
> hbox list jq
- jq:
  - latest âœ”
> jq --version
jq-1.7.1
> hbox add node latest
latest: Pulling from library/node
...
Added 'node' version latest.
> hbox list
- jq:
  - latest âœ”
- node:
  - latest âœ”
> hbox list node
- node:
  - latest âœ”
> node --version
v22.0.0
> hbox add node 14 --set-default
'node' version 14 set as default.
14: Pulling from library/node
...
Added 'node' version 14.
> hbox list node
- node:
  - 14 âœ”
  - latest
> node --version
v14.21.3
> hbox use node latest
'node' set to version latest
> node --version
v22.0.0
> hbox list node
- node:
  - 14
  - latest âœ”
```

These examples should provide a quick start guide for you to understand the basic operations that you can perform with hbox.
