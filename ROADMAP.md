# Roadmap

List of ideas I want to implement in the future.

- Miscellaneous:
  - Support private registries and mirrors
   - maybe via registry mapping in `config.json`?
  - Add a .gif showcasing hbox
  - Update GitHub workflows to
    - upload binaries to release
    - add linters and code format
    - add static analysis
    - add image scanning
  - Create an index/registry repository
  - Use shards to get better performance in git repositories

  - Double check if registered packages are available locally before using them
  - Manage volumes to avoid lose data
    - probably better to manage them by package + version 
  - Make it easier to build custom images based on templates
    - pass relevant build args, like IMAGE_NAME and IMAGE_VERSION
  - Try to update config files from `.json` to `.yaml` or `.toml`
  - Mask relevant information added to logs
  - Allow override configs and versions in a local folder, via `.hbox` file (or other file extension)
    - Traverse parent directories until a `.hbox` config file is found
      - does it need to define depth level?
  - Add version to config files to specify their formats to allow check for future compatibility
  - [Experimental] Allow forced flags in docker run, based on pattern matching
- New commands
  - Add auto update `hbox upgrade`
  - Add `hbox update` to update index
  - Add `hbox register` to register a package, even with custom image
  - Add `hbox verify` to check if there's something wrong with packages or with container engine:
    - Verify if `docker` or `podman` are installed and available
      - Verify if there are container images for the current version of each package
  - Add command `hbox reshim` to regenerate shims
  - *Experimental*: Identify paths in `hbox run` to map them via container volumes automatically
- Updated commands:
  - Add option to keep containers instead of using `--rm`
    - maybe adding custom tags to them to identify them easily?
    - define lifecycle rules:
      - should we reuse them or always create a new one?
      - should volumes be reused between them?
  - Add option to remove images when removing packages via `hbox remove/uninstall`
  - Add support to colors in `hbox run` output when possible (*nix only?)
  - On `hbox add/install` add warn when a shim will conflict with an existing command
- Technical debt:
  - Add unit and integration tests
    - it should run on Linux and Windows
